how to exploit pin2 (ref pin) from KY-008 laser module
[Keyes KY-008 Laser Transmitter Demystified : 3 Steps - Instructables](https://www.instructables.com/Keyes-KY-008-Laser-Transmitter-Demystified/)
Pin1 = Vdc
Pin2 = Ref
Pin3 = GND

the code with uno. file named "Laser_B" seems not to work with my Nod32s due to lack of reference pin A0 in the board (if I not misunderstood, it will be output voltage value from Arduino board to any module)
